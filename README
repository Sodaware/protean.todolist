Version:      1.0
Release Date: 3rd September, 2007
Licence:      Free to use without restriction.


Description
-----------

This is a plugin for Protean IDE (http://www.nullcity.com/Posts/Show/ProteanIDE)

It scans the project source files for comment tags such as “TODO:”. These tags 
are typically used for making notes in code, such as reminders to clean up
functions or notes about potential problems that may need fixing later.


Build Instructions
------------------

To build the plugin you'll need to add references to the following core Protean
libraries:

    * Hub.dll
    * SandBar.dll
    * Compona.SyntaxDocument.dll
    * Tarro.dll
    * Compona.SyntaxBox.dll
    * Compona.CoreLib.dll

Protean is built with .NET 1.1, and this plugin needs to be built for the same
framework.


Quick Installation Guide
------------------------

Copy the folder “TodoList” to your Protean “Plugins” folder. When you run
Protean again, the plugin should be enabled and ready to roll.


Usage
-----

Once the plugin has been installed, it can be enabled by selecting “Task List”
from the Protean view menu. To scan loaded files, click the “refresh” button on
the task pane’s toolbar.

Todo List searches for the following tags at the start of comments:

TASK:, KLUDGE:, HACK:, NOTE:, TEMP:

For example, the following comment would generate a Todo entry in the Hack
category:

; HACK: This is a hack.
someBlitzCodeHere()

Tasks can be filtered using the drop-down menu, and can be sorted by their line
number, filename, type and description.
